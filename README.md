Sales Tracking Program

Overview

The Sales Tracking Program helps small business owners track their sales performance and determine if they are meeting their financial goals. The program reads item data from a file, calculates total income based on user input, and assesses whether the business has reached the break-even point.

Features

•	Data Reading: Imports item data (names, cost prices, and selling prices) from a file named `items.txt`.
•	Income Calculation: Calculates the total income from sales of different items based on user input.
•	Break-Even Analysis: Determines if the business has met or exceeded the break-even point, which is the number of items that need to be sold to cover fixed costs.

How to Use

1. Prepare the Data File:
   - Create a file named `items.txt` in the same directory as the program.
   - Format each line in the file as follows: `ItemName#CostPrice@SellingPrice`
     - Example: `Widget#5.00@10.00`

2. Run the Program:
   - Execute the program script.
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of units sold for each item listed in the `items.txt` file.

3. View Results:
   - The program will display the income generated from each item.
   - It will also show if the average number of items sold meets, exceeds, or falls short of the break-even point.

Troubleshooting

•	File Not Found: Ensure that `items.txt` is in the same directory as the program.
•	Formatting Errors: Verify that the `items.txt` file follows the correct format (e.g., `ItemName#CostPrice@SellingPrice`).
